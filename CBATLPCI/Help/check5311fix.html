		<H1>Security Updates, Update Rollups, and Service Packs</H1>
		<H2>Issue</H2>
		<P>To ensure that the most recent security updates are applied, you need to install 
			all of the latest service packs, update rollups and individual updates on your 
			system.</P>
		<H2>Solution</H2>
		<P>The scan report identifies which service packs, update rollups and security 
			updates are missing on your computer. Users can click the link in the security 
			report to view the
			<NOLOC>Microsoft</NOLOC>
			security bulletin or download page, which includes the install location for the 
			security update. The <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=42632"><NOLOC>Microsoft 
				Update</NOLOC></A> web site also has the latest service pack and security update 
			releases available for you to download for the
			<NOLOC>Microsoft&reg;</NOLOC>
			<NOLOC>Windows&reg;</NOLOC> operating system and its components as well as other 
			<NOLOC>Microsoft</NOLOC> products.</P>
		<P>In order to obtain and install the latest updates and to effectively use the 
			MBSA results, please observe these guidelines:</P>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Visit the <A HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=42632"><NOLOC>Microsoft 
				Update</NOLOC></A> Web site to install the updates, unless more control is 
			needed in which updates you wish to install or download.  The location of the download package
			is available in the Download column of the report.  Packages are typically in EXE, 
			MSI or CAB format, and can be saved or opened after clicking the Download icon.
			<li>
				Register with the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=31119"><NOLOC>Microsoft</NOLOC> 
					Security Notification Service</a>
			to ensure you are notified when new security bulletins become available.
			<li>
			When updating your computer, remember that changes in configuration may require 
			additional use of <NOLOC>Microsoft Update</NOLOC> or MBSA to check the new configuration for 
			compliance. This is particularly true when installing applications, or adding 
			new optional components such as Internet Information Services (IIS) which may 
			install programs that have not been updated with the latest fixes.
			<li>
				By clicking on <b>Result Details</b> in the report you will be able to identify 
				the updates needed to protect your computer:</li>
		</ul>
		<blockquote>

			<p><b>Security Updates</b></p>
			<P><i>Items marked with <IMG SRC="../Graphics/mini_x_red.gif" WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="16"> are confirmed missing.</i></P>
			<P>These updates require immediate installation to protect your computer.</P>

			<P><br><b>Update Rollups and Service Packs</b></P>
			<P><i>Items marked with <IMG SRC="../Graphics/mini_x_gold.gif" WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="16"> are confirmed missing.</i></P>
			<p>You should obtain and install the latest service pack or update rollup by using the 
				download link provided in the report prior to installing other updates.  Service packs and update rollups contain multiple security fixes, and by installing the latest ones, fewer of the individual security updates would be required.</P>
<P class="note">Note</P>
<UL>
    <LI>
      MBSA reports a non-critical check failure if a scanned computer running Windows&nbsp;XP does not have Service Pack 2 (SP2) installed. If Service Pack 1 (SP1) also is not installed on the computer, however, you should consider this a critical failure that should be corrected as soon as possible by installing SP2 on the computer. 
    </LI>
</UL>		
			<p><br><b>Current Update Compliance</b></p>
			<p><i>Items marked with <IMG SRC="../Graphics/mini_chek_grn.gif" WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="16"> represent the most current
			updates protecting your computer. If you have installed a recent update, it may incorporate 
			previous updates that will no longer appear in this list, but are still providing protection.</i></p>

			<p>This section of the report can be used to confirm that the computer is protected by the update that you recently installed.  As updates become older, they can be replaced by other updates.  If you require more information about the older updates, the fixlist of the replacement update documented by product support should be used.  The fixlist and other support information can usually be obtained by clicking on the update description in the report.</p>


		<p><br><b>Unapproved Updates</b></p>

		<p>In addition to the items confirmed missing, other items may not be approved for use in some managed corporate environments.  These updates are displayed with this informational message:</p>

		<p><i>Items marked with <IMG SRC="../Graphics/mini_star_blu.gif" WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="16"> are confirmed missing and are not approved by your system administrator.</i></p>

		<p>Because these items are not approved, installing them may cause problems for certain applications or your computer, or your system administrator may be in the process of deploying the update in stages across the organization.</p>
