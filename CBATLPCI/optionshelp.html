		<H1>Scanning Options</H1>
		<P>For each scan, the following options can be enabled or disabled as 
		needed in the 
			<NOLOC>Microsoft</NOLOC> Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) user interface:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>
			Check for
			<NOLOC>Windows</NOLOC> administrative vulnerabilities
			<LI>
			Check for weak passwords
			<LI>
			Check for Internet Information Services (IIS) administrative vulnerabilities
			<LI>
			Check for
			<NOLOC>SQL</NOLOC> administrative vulnerabilities
			<LI>
				Check for security updates (missing updates)</LI>
		</UL>
		<H2><NOLOC>Windows</NOLOC> administrative vulnerability checks</H2>
<P>
			This group of checks scans for security issues in the <NOLOC>Windows</NOLOC> operating system, such as Guest account status, file-system type, 
			available file shares, and members of the Administrators group. Descriptions of 
			each <NOLOC>Windows</NOLOC> check are shown in the security report, with instructions on how 
			to fix any issues that are found.</P>
		<H2>Weak passwords check</H2>
<P>
		MBSA checks computers for blank and weak 
		passwords during a scan. This check can take a long time, depending on the 
		number of user accounts on the computer. This check has been disabled 
		when the target client is a domain controller to reduce the number of 
		passwords that are checked. Note that this check may 
		produce event-log entries in the Security log if auditing is enabled on the 
		computer for logon/logoff events. If this option is not selected, the Windows 
		and <NOLOC>SQL Server</NOLOC> account password checks are not performed.
		<H2><NOLOC>IIS</NOLOC> administrative vulnerability checks</H2>
<P>
			This group of checks scans for security issues in <NOLOC>IIS</NOLOC>&nbsp;such as sample applications and certain 
			virtual directories present on the computer. MBSA also checks if the <A ID="MSUrl" HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=16536" TARGET="_blank">
				<NOLOC>IIS</NOLOC> Lockdown tool</A> has been run on the computer, which can help an 
			administrator configure and secure servers running <NOLOC>IIS</NOLOC>. Descriptions of each 
			<NOLOC>IIS</NOLOC> check are shown in the security reports, with instructions on how to fix 
			any issues that are found.</P>
		<H2><NOLOC>SQL Server</NOLOC> administrative vulnerability checks</H2>
<P>
			This group of checks scans for administrative vulnerabilities on each instance 
			of <NOLOC>SQL Server</NOLOC> and <NOLOC>Microsoft</NOLOC> Data Engine (MSDE) found on the computer, such as the type 
			of authentication mode, sa account password status, and service account 
			memberships. All individual checks are performed on each instance of <NOLOC>SQL Server</NOLOC> and MSDE. Descriptions of each check are shown in the security reports, with 
			instructions on how to fix any issues that are found.</P>
			
		<p>MSDE is a data engine built and based on core <NOLOC>SQL Server</NOLOC> technology. It is a 
			redistributable database engine that supports single- and dual-processor 
			desktop computers. MSDE is packaged in a self-extracting archive for ease of 
			distribution and embedding. Since it is fully compatible with other editions of 
			<NOLOC>SQL Server</NOLOC>, users can upgrade from MSDE to <NOLOC>SQL Server</NOLOC> if an application grows 
			beyond the storage and scalability limits of MSDE. MSDE is not 
		supported on <NOLOC>Windows Vista</NOLOC> or higher operating systems.</p>

		<H2>Security updates check</H2>
<P>
			Scanning computers for security updates uses <NOLOC>Microsoft Update</NOLOC> and 
			<NOLOC>WSUS</NOLOC> technologies. MBSA 
			provides integration for unmanaged clients that use <NOLOC>Microsoft Update</NOLOC> and 
			clients managed by <NOLOC>WSUS</NOLOC>, SMS or SCCM administrators and is a comprehensive 
			standalone tool for the information technology professional.  When 
			needed, MBSA also uses an offline catalog that is updated by <NOLOC>Microsoft</NOLOC> every time new security updates are 
			released.  This catalog is used to check the status of security updates on the computers being 
			scanned.  If any security updates in the catalog are not installed on the 
			scanned computer, MBSA flags these updates in the security report. MBSA 
			scans for missing security updates, service packs and update rollups for 
			all products supported by Microsoft 
			Update. For information regarding products not 
			supported by <NOLOC>Microsoft Update</NOLOC> and <NOLOC>WSUS</NOLOC> server, see the
			<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=16534">MBSA home 
			page</a>.</P>
		<p><b>Note:</b> For products that are not installed on a scanned computer, the 
			security updates check is not performed for those products and is not listed in the Security Update Scan Results table in the report. 
		<p><b>Note:</b> For products that are not supported by <NOLOC>Microsoft Update</NOLOC>, 
		no security update check will be performed. Since MBSA will not 
		report missing security updates for products not supported by Microsoft 
		Update, it is critical to determine whether all products in the scanned 
		environment are supported by <NOLOC>Microsoft Update</NOLOC> and WSUS technologies. For 
		information regarding products not supported by <NOLOC>Microsoft Update</NOLOC> and 
		WSUS technologies, see the
		<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=16534">MBSA home page</a>.</p>

			<DT><B>Configure computers for <NOLOC>Microsoft Update</NOLOC> and scanning prerequisites</B></DT>
<DD>
				This option is off by default in MBSA. When enabled, this option 
				allows MBSA to automatically install or update the <NOLOC>Windows</NOLOC> Update Agent 
				on each target client to 
				the WUA version needed for a security update scan to be 
				successful. <NOLOC>Windows</NOLOC> Installer is also 
				required for scanning certain products and the scan will report whether 
				<NOLOC>Windows</NOLOC> Installer needs to be updated or other prerequisites for 
				performing a successful scan are missing. Computers with an Internet connection 
				with Automatic Updates enabled are updated automatically. 
				Target clients that do not meet the requirements for a 
				successful scan cannot be scanned for updates without the correct 
				version of these needed WUA client components. Keeping this 
				option in its default state (not selected) ensures that the 
				scanning process does not alter the target computer configuration, but could 
				result in some computers or products not being scanned until the 
				Windows Update Agent is updated.<P>If the computer is managed by a <NOLOC>WSUS</NOLOC> server, using this option 
			does not interfere with managed updates or settings. Computers that 
			have Automatic Updates turned off continue to be turned off. 
			Computers that have Automatic Updates turned on may begin to receive 
			Automatic Updates reminders if this option is used unless the client 
			is assigned to a
			<NOLOC>WSUS</NOLOC> 
			server. Administrators that have configured the 
				Automatic Updates service to be disabled should first ensure the Automatic 
				Updates setting is turned off before using this option if they are using another 
				update management solution.</P>
			<P>Computers that are not managed by <NOLOC>Windows Server Update Services</NOLOC> may receive Automatic Updates reminders 
				for the additional content published to <NOLOC>Microsoft Update</NOLOC> depending upon how 
				Automatic Updates has been configured. These additional items may include 
				updates for <NOLOC>Microsoft Office</NOLOC> or <NOLOC>SQL Server</NOLOC>, for example.</P>
			<P>These features can be controlled separately when scanning from the command 
				line.</P>
			<P>By default, scanning uses <NOLOC>Microsoft Update</NOLOC> and the client's 
			<NOLOC>WSUS</NOLOC> 
			server if it is assigned one. Using advanced <NOLOC>Update Services</NOLOC> options, you can perform a security update 
				check that uses only the list of approved updates from your local 
			<NOLOC>WSUS</NOLOC> server, 
				or ignore that list and scan using only <NOLOC>Microsoft Update</NOLOC>.  By default, 
				items not in the list of approved updates on the assigned <NOLOC>WSUS</NOLOC>
			server are given only 
				an informational score.</P>
</DD>
			<DT><B>Use additional catalogs</B></DT>
<DD>
				This option is only available when additional <NOLOC>Microsoft</NOLOC> catalogs 
				are available.&nbsp; If this option is not selected, MBSA will 
				not use additional catalogs in the security update check, even if they are present.</DD>
		<DT><B>Advanced <NOLOC>Update Services</NOLOC> options:</B></DT>
		<DD>
		<DL>
		<DT><B>Scan using assigned <NOLOC>Windows Update Services</NOLOC> servers only</B></DT>
		<DD>Use this option in managed <NOLOC>WSUS</NOLOC> server 
		environments. With this option selected, clients that are not 
		assigned to a <NOLOC>WSUS</NOLOC> server will receive an error message in 
			the report indicating they could not be scanned.  This option allows a 
		<NOLOC>WSUS</NOLOC>
		server 
		administrator a way to ensure that only managed computers are included, and as a result, only approved updates are included and graded in 
			the reports.</DD>
		<DT><B>Scan using <NOLOC>Microsoft Update</NOLOC> only</B></DT>
			
			<DD>Use this option to assess security updates using the <NOLOC>Microsoft Update</NOLOC> site and ignore any approved updates on  
			computers that are assigned to a <NOLOC>WSUS</NOLOC> server. If the 
			<NOLOC>Microsoft Update</NOLOC> site is not accessible, the offline catalog will be 
			used. This  option causes all updates to be graded using 
			critical or noncritical warnings instead of the informational score used for 
			unapproved <NOLOC>WSUS</NOLOC> updates.</DD>
		<DT><B>Scan using offline cata<NOLOC>log </NOLOC>
		only</B></DT>
			
			<DD>Use this option to assess security updates using the offline 
			catalog only and ignore the <NOLOC>Microsoft Update</NOLOC> site and any approved updates on  
			computers that are assigned to a <NOLOC>WSUS</NOLOC> server.</DD>
		<DT><B>Scan using additional catalogs only</B></DT>
			
			<DD>This option is only available when additional <NOLOC>Microsoft</NOLOC> catalogs 
			are available. Use this option to assess security updates using 
			additional catalogs only and ignore the <NOLOC>Microsoft Update</NOLOC> site and any approved updates on  
			computers that are assigned to a <NOLOC>WSUS</NOLOC> server.</DD>
